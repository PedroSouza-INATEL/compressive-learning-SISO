# compressive-learning-SISO
Code (ML_NN_SISO.py is the main code) for generating numerical results (detection performance only) presented in the paper "Compressive learning in communication systems: A neural network receiver for detecting compressed signals in OFDM systems".

Parameters are configured to partly simulate the scenario investigated in Figure 4 "MLD and NND detection performances under imperfect  CSI (not perfect CSI for NND here) as a function of SNR and multiple compression rates."

The module signal_processing.py is necessary for the simulation to work properly.
