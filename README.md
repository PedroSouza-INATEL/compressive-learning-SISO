# compressive-learning-SISO
Code for generating numerical results presented in the paper "Compressive learning in communication systems: A neural network receiver for detecting compressed signals in OFDM systems".

Parameters are configured to simulate the scenario investigated in Figure 4 "MLD and NND detection performances under imperfect CSI as a function of SNR and multiple compression rates."

The module signal_processing.py is necessary for the correct execution of the simulation.
